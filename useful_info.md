### The context parameter:
The context is an object provided by Next.js containing several useful properties that can be used within getServerSideProps. The most important part here is:
context.req: This is the request object that contains all the headers and cookies sent by the client (like the authentication cookie), which are needed to fetch the session.

### The redirect logic:
If no session is found, you’re redirecting the user to the login page with redirect('/pages/login').
Permanent (false or true): This flag indicates whether the redirect is a permanent redirect (301) or a temporary redirect (302).
A temporary redirect (302) means the user can still go back to the original page after login, as it’s not a permanent redirect. The permanent redirect (301) is used if you want to indicate a long-term change (not needed here).
This happens before rendering the layout, meaning the layout will not be rendered at all if there’s no session, and the user will be redirected first.

### What happens if the session exists?:
If a session exists, the code does not return the redirect. Instead, it returns an empty props object.
This is because getServerSideProps needs to return an object with the necessary props for the page to be rendered. Since your layout doesn’t require any specific props (besides checking the session), you can return an empty object.
return { props: {} }: This is the default behavior when you don’t need to pass any specific data to the page. The DashboardLayout will render normally with the children passed to it.

### Authorize in the Provider API
The authorize function in NextAuth is responsible for authenticating the user when they log in. After verifying the user's credentials (username and password), it can return additional data from the database to be included in the session.
